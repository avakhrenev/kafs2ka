Trying to build a kafka driver from scratch with the power of fs2.

## Goals
- support latest version of kafka only
- fully support features of latest kafka (transactions)
- explicit api (explicit batches)

Also there is a personal goal to master fs2 and various techniques behind it (GADT representation, `Segment` fusion e.t.c.)
